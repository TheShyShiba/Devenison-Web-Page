Hello, everyone.

This project is a simple and minimalistic Web Page for someone who requested the look and feel of Linktree, but a little more upgraded.

Coding languages that I used for this project are: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Please note that I am a beginner in Web Development and still have a long way to go before I feel completely confident. However, I am happy to have someone who was willing to give me a chance and to see if I could do this task.

Thank you and enjoy.
